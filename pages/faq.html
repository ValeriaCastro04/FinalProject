                <h2>‚ÅâÔ∏è  How do I enroll in courses during my first year?</h2>
                <p>
                    During your first two trimesters, you do not need to register for courses 
                    by selecting available spots. Simply go to the academic registration 
                    page and navigate to the enrollment section. There, you will be able to 
                    enroll in your courses automatically, and your section will also be assigned 
                    automatically. The first enrollment process can be confusing, but don't worry‚Äîit's 
                    straightforward. 
                    <br>
                    Starting from your third trimester, you will need to 
                    select your courses yourself. To do this, return to the academic 
                    registration page, go to the enrollment section, and choose the 
                    courses you want to enroll in from the dropdown menu. Then, click 
                    the enroll button to complete your registration.

            <h2>‚ÅâÔ∏è  Where can I see my grades?</h2>
            <p>
                To view your grades, simply go to the academic registration page and log in. Then, navigate to the grades section. There, you will find information about all the courses you have taken and the grades you received in each one. You can also see the credit value for each course, check if you have failed any subjects, and view any equivalencies you may have.

            <h2>‚ÅâÔ∏è  How can I change my major?</h2>
            <p>
                Changing your major can be a bit confusing since there is not a guide to do it. If you want to switch to a different major, you first need to speak with the dean of your current program and request the change. After that, you should meet with the dean of the new program you wish to join and explain your reasons for switching. If approved, the dean will process the change in the academic records system. You should see the update on the academic registration page within a few days or up to a week. If the change does not appear, contact the academic records office to confirm the update and ask for assistance. Sometimes, updates are visible only to faculty before they appear for students.

            <h2>‚ÅâÔ∏è  How do I withdraw from a course?</h2>
            <p>
                You can withdraw from a course only during the first three weeks of the trimester. To do so, you need to send an email to your dean or schedule a meeting to explain your reasons for withdrawing. The dean will then process the withdrawal directly in the academic system.

            <h2>‚ÅâÔ∏è  How can I find out which classroom my class is in?</h2>
            <p>
            There are two ways to do this. The first is to go to the academic registration page and check your schedule in the enrollment section. There, you can see the classroom assigned to each of your classes, organized by day and time.
            <br>
            Alternatively, if you want to see if a particular classroom is being used for an activity, you can visit the following page: <br>
            <a href="https://aulas.esen.edu.sv/day.php" target="_blank">https://aulas.esen.edu.sv/day.php</a>
            <br>
            This page provides information about all the classrooms at ESEN and shows whether they are reserved for classes, extracurricular activities, or student associations.
