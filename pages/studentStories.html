        <aside><b>Mariana G√≥mez - Licenciatura en Econom√≠a y Negocios</b><br><br>"Joining ESEN as an economics student was a turning point for me. The mix of theory and practical insights in the curriculum has helped me see beyond numbers‚Äîhow economic decisions impact both individuals and businesses. One of my highlights was working on a project that analyzed El Salvador's economic development, which was then presented at a national conference. I feel prepared to contribute to economic growth in my country.‚Äù</aside>

At first, I struggled with the pace of law courses, but the professors‚Äô approachability and support allowed me to dive deep into subjects like constitutional law and human rights. Being surrounded by like-minded, passionate people has made me realize how powerful law can be in shaping society, and I can‚Äôt wait to contribute to the legal community.‚Äù</aside>
