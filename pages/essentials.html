      <h2>📅 Your Semester Survival Calendar</h2>
      <p>
        When do classes start? When should you <em>panic-study</em> for midterms? 😅<br>
        Don’t worry — everything’s mapped out here:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ <strong>Start of classes:</strong> Know when your academic adventure begins!</li>
        <li>📝 <strong>Partial & Final Exams:</strong> Yep, they’re already scheduled. Plan ahead.</li>
        <li>🌴 <strong>Vacations:</strong> (Yes, you get breaks — use them wisely!)</li>

        <li>📌 <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Take note of <u>holidays</u> (no classes!)</li>

      <h2>🕒 Class Schedules & Room Locations</h2>
      <p>
        Want to know what's happening on campus right now? ESEN's classroom overview lets you see the real-time schedule of classes, including where each one takes place — classrooms, auditoriums, and tech labs included.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a super useful tool to plan your day, check available rooms for study sessions in big groups, or make sure you're heading to the right place! 😉

      <h2>💻 How to Use the Virtual Platforms</h2>
      <p>ESEN uses two main online platforms that you'll be using a lot. Here's a quick breakdown so you don’t get lost:</p>

      <h3>Moodle (📚)</h3>
      <p>
        This is where your classes live online. Teachers upload slides, videos, homework, and quizzes here. You can submit assignments and check feedback as well.
      </p>

      </a>

      <h3>Academic Records System (🧾)</h3>
      <p>
        This is more administrative. You’ll see your grades, your academic transcript (CUM), and make official requests here. From second year on, you'll also enroll in your classes using this platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        You’ll also use it to evaluate your professors and apply for assistant positions in certain courses.

      </a>

      <p style="margin-top: 15px;">
        To access both, you’ll need login credentials that the university provides. If you haven't received them yet, ask your coordinator or the help desk.

    <div class="card" id="study-rooms">
      <h2>📚 Study Rooms at the Knowledge Center</h2>
      <p>
        Planning a study session with friends? ESEN's <strong>Knowledge Center</strong> offers reservable rooms you can check online. You’ll see what rooms are already booked and for how long.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>👥 <strong>Small rooms require at least 3 people</strong> to use them.</li>
        <li>👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Got a big group (8+)? Ask for the large study room.</li>
        <li>🧽 Each room has a whiteboard — get markers and erasers at the front desk.</li>
        <li>🚫 <strong>No food allowed</strong> in the rooms.</li>
        <li>🔇 Please keep your voice down — other groups are working too!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Booking a room means more focus and fewer distractions. Plan ahead and secure your spot!
