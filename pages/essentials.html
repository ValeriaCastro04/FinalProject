        <h2>💻 How to Use the Virtual Platforms</h2>
        <p>ESEN uses two main online platforms that you'll be using a lot. Here's a quick breakdown so you don’t get lost:</p>
        
        <h3>Moodle (📚)</h3>
        <p>
            This is where your classes live online. Teachers upload slides, videos, homework, and quizzes here. You can submit assignments and check feedback as well.
        </p>
        <a 
            href="https://moodle.esen.edu.sv/login/index.php" 
            target="_blank" 
            class="btn-link"
        >
            🔗 Access Moodle
        </a>

        <h3>Academic Records System (🧾)</h3>
        <p>
            This is more administrative. You’ll see your grades, your academic transcript (CUM), and make official requests here. From second year on, you'll also enroll in your classes using this platform.
        </p>
        <p>
            You’ll also use it to evaluate your professors and apply for assistant positions in certain courses.
        </p>

        >
            🔗 Access Academic Records
        </a>

        <p style="margin-top: 15px;">
            To access both, you’ll need login credentials that the university provides. If you haven't received them yet, ask your coordinator or the help desk.
        </p>

        <h2>📚 Study Rooms at the Knowledge Center</h2>
        <p>
            Planning a study session with friends? ESEN's <strong>Knowledge Center</strong> offers reservable rooms you can check online. You’ll see what rooms are already booked and for how long.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>👥 <strong>Small rooms require at least 3 people</strong> to use them.</li>
            <li>👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Got a big group (8+)? Ask for the large study room.</li>
            <li>🧽 Each room has a whiteboard — get markers and erasers at the front desk.</li>
            <li>🚫 <strong>No food allowed</strong> in the rooms.</li>
            <li>🔇 Please keep your voice down — other groups are working too!</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Booking a room means more focus and fewer distractions. Plan ahead and secure your spot!
