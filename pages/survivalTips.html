      <h2>📚 Study Smarter, Not Harder</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>🧠 <b>Understand > Memorize</b> — ESEN loves analysis and application. Know the “why” behind everything.</li>
        <li>📅 <b>Create a weekly study plan</b> — Block time for every subject (and breaks too!). Google Calendar is your bestie.</li>
        <li>👥 <b>Form or join a study group</b> — Don’t wait until finals. Two minds are better than one. Five is a power move.</li>
        <li>📱 <b>Use tech tools</b> — Notion, Quizlet, Anki, and ChatGPT can save hours of your life.</li>
        <li>🪫 <b>Know your limits</b> — If your brain is fried, REST. No badge of honor for burnout.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>😵‍💫 Avoiding Meltdown 101</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>😴 <b>Sleep is sacred</b> — Pulling all-nighters messes up your focus and mood. Try 7 hours, minimum.</li>
        <li>💧 <b>Hydrate, stretch, move</b> — Water and short walks actually boost retention and energy.</li>
        <li>📣 <b>Talk to someone</b> — Professors, friends, or counselors. Don’t keep it all in your head.</li>
        <li>🎯 <b>Focus on progress, not perfection</b> — 80% done is better than 0% perfect.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>💼 Business School = Leadership Playground</h2>
      <p>You'll take classes like <strong>Leadership Fundamentals</strong>, <strong>Total Wellness</strong>, and <strong>Teamwork</strong> — but don’t treat them like "extra" subjects. They're tools for life and for every career ahead.</p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>👔 <b>Step up during group work</b> — This is where real leadership starts (not just in theory).</li>
        <li>🙋 <b>Ask questions and participate</b> — These subjects reward curiosity and authenticity.</li>
        <li>🧘 <b>Take the wellness part seriously</b> — You’ll be surprised how much it affects your productivity.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>🔥 Power Tips from Survivors</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>📎 <b>Keep all your files in Google Drive</b> — organized by course and week. Your future self will thank you.</li>
        <li>🎧 <b>Study playlists are magic</b> — Lo-fi, jazz, movie soundtracks… whatever gets you in the zone.</li>
        <li>🙌 <b>Celebrate the small wins</b> — Turned in an assignment? SURVIVED AN EXAM? That’s huge.</li>
        <li>📚 <b>Don’t be afraid to visit professors during office hours</b> — most love helping students who show interest.</li>
        <li>🧾 <b>Learn to love the syllabus</b> — It’s basically a roadmap to survive each class.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>💬 Final Thought</h2>
      <p>
        You’re not alone in this — everyone at ESEN has had a “what am I doing here?” moment. What matters most is that you ask for help when needed, stay open to feedback, and keep going. 🌱
      </p>
      <br>
      <p style="font-style: italic;">You’re not just here to pass courses — you’re here to become the kind of leader the world actually needs. No pressure 😅</p>
